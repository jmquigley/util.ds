"},"index.html":{"id":"index.html","title":"Index","body":" Documentation Classes CollectionDequeNodeQueueStack util.ds Simple data structures This module contains my implementation of a few basic data structures using Typescript. I could have used other implementations, but what fun is that. It Contains the following data structures: Stack Queue Deque UsageStackTo create a simple stack use: const Stack = require('util.ds'); let stack = new Stack(); stack.push(1); let val = stack.pop(); `When an element is added to the stack an add event fires. When an element is removed from the stack a remove event fires. QueueTo create a simple queue use: const Queue = require('util.ds'); let q = new Queue(); q.enqueue(1); let val = q.dequeue();When an element is added to the queue an add event fires. When an element is removed from the queue a remove event fires. DequeA deque is a double ended queue. An element can be inserted at either end of the queue. const Deque = require('util.ds'); let q = new Deque(); q.enqueue(1); let val = q.dequeue();This example works like a typical queue. However this type allows one to add items at either end. When an element is added to the deque an add event fires. When an element is removed from the deque a remove event fires. The deque can have items added to either end: const Deque = require('util.ds'); let q = new Deque(); q.pushFront(1); q.pushBack(2); let val = q.popFront(); val = q.popBack();A deque can also be limited in size: const Deque = require('util.ds'); let q = new Deque(5); for (let i: number = 0; i &lt; 5; i++) { q.enqueue(i); } q.enqueue(6);This will add 5 items to the queue. The last item adds a 6th element. That will cause the first item in the queue to be removed automatically before the new item is enqueued. This provides a way to &quot;age&quot; items within the queue. When the item is removed a remove event fires. The front item in the queue is considered the oldest item. APIThe API is generated with JSDoc. It can be found within the docs directory for the project. It can be generated with npm run docs. × Search results Close Documentation generated by JSDoc 3.4.3 on February 24th 2017, 1:52:24 pm using the DocStrap template.

"},"Deque.html":{"id":"Deque.html","title":"Class: Deque","body":" Documentation Classes CollectionDequeNodeQueueStack Class: Deque Deque A double ended Queue class new Deque( [maxSize], cmp) The deque can be unlimited in size (default) or set to a maxium size when constructed. When the max size is exceeded, then the front item is automatially removed from the queue and the new item is placed in the queue (dependin which type of insert is calld). Parameters: Name Type Argument Default Description maxSize number &lt;optional&gt; 0 The maximum size for this queue. cmp function null a comparator function used for searching within the container. Methods enqueue(data) Adds an item to the end of the queue. Checks for an overflow condition and acts if one is detected. Parameters: Name Type Description data Object the data item to add to the queue. overflow() Checks the current internals for an overflow condition. This occurs when the maxSize storage size will be exceeded on the next insert operation. Returns: true if in an overflow condition, otherwise false. Type boolean peekBack() Returns the last item in the queue without removing it. Returns: a copy of the last item in the list. Type Object peekFront() Returns the first item in the queue without removing it. Returns: a copy of the first item in the list. Type Object popBack() Retrieves the last item from the queue and removes it. Returns: the data value on the back of the queue. Type Object popFront() Returns the first item from the queue and removes it. Returns: the data value on the front of the queue. Type Object pushBack(data) Adds an item to the end of the queue. Checks for an overflow condition and acts if one is detected. Parameters: Name Type Description data Object the data item to add to the queue. pushFront(data) Inserts a data element to the front of the queue. Checks for an overflow condition and acts if one is detected. Parameters: Name Type Description data Object the data item to add to the queue. × Search results Close Documentation generated by JSDoc 3.4.3 on February 24th 2017, 1:52:24 pm using the DocStrap template.
