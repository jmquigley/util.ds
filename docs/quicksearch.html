I could have used other implementations, but what fun is that. It Contains the following data structures: Stack Queue Deque InstallationTo install as an application dependency: $ npm install --save util.dsTo build the app and run all tests: $ npm run allUsageStackTo create a simple stack use: const Stack = require('util.ds'); let stack = new Stack(); stack.push(1); let val = stack.pop(); `When an element is added to the stack an add event fires. When an element is removed from the stack a remove event fires. QueueTo create a simple queue use: const Queue = require('util.ds'); let q = new Queue(); q.enqueue(1); let val = q.dequeue();When an element is added to the queue an add event fires. When an element is removed from the queue a remove event fires. DequeA deque is a double ended queue. An element can be inserted at either end of the queue. const Deque = require('util.ds'); let q = new Deque(); q.enqueue(1); let val = q.dequeue();This example works like a typical queue. However this type allows one to add items at either end. When an element is added to the deque an add event fires. When an element is removed from the deque a remove event fires. The deque can have items added to either end: const Deque = require('util.ds'); let q = new Deque(); q.pushFront(1); q.pushBack(2); let val = q.popFront(); val = q.popBack();A deque can also be limited in size: const Deque = require('util.ds'); let q = new Deque(5); for (let i: number = 0; i &lt; 5; i++) { q.enqueue(i); } q.enqueue(6);This will add 5 items to the queue. The last item adds a 6th element. That will cause the first item in the queue to be removed automatically before the new item is enqueued. This provides a way to &quot;age&quot; items within the queue. When the item is removed a remove event fires. The front item in the queue is considered the oldest item.
