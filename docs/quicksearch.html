When the max size is exceeded, then the front item is automatially removed from the queue and the new item is placed in the queue (dependin which type of insert is calld). Parameters: Name Type Argument Description maxSize number &lt;optional&gt; The maximum size for this queue. Methods overflow() Checks the current internals for an overflow condition. This occurs when the maxSize storage size will be exceeded on the next insert operation. Returns: true if in an overflow condition, otherwise false. Type boolean peekBack() Returns the last item in the queue without removing it. Returns: a copy of the last item in the list. Type Object peekFront() Returns the first item in the queue without removing it. Returns: a copy of the first item in the list. Type Object popBack() Retrieves the last item from the queue and removes it. Returns: the data value on the back of the queue. Type Object popFront() Returns the first item from the queue and removes it. Returns: the data value on the front of the queue. Type Object pushBack(data) Adds an item to the end of the queue. Checks for an overflow condition and acts if one is detected. Parameters: Name Type Description data Object the data item to add to the queue. pushFront(data) Inserts a data element to the front of the queue.
